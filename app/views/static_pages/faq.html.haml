        What is heartburn?
      %br
      Acid reflux is a burning sensation that often occurs after a heavy meal, following a stressful situation, or after drinking alcohol. The pain may spread into the neck, throat, and jawline. Heartburn is usually caused by the overproduction of gastric acid out of the stomach and if untreated overtime can lead to serious harmful complications such as active ulceration of the stomach, intestine, or erosion of the esophagus.
