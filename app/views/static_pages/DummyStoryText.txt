  It starts with one man and a big idea. Dr. John Geibel, of Yale Medical School believed that a smarter, simpler solution could relieve painful acid reflux using minerals and natural ingredients. Searching for a better and safer solution to heartburn, Dr. Geibel found the answer: Zinc.
%p
  At Yale Business School, Dr. Geibel met Hasan, a bright young student who had spent a long time trying to find a safer and better solution to his own heartburn issues. After just one use of Dr. Geibel's formula, he was so blown away by the immediate and long-lasting relief, that he made it his mission to bring this new solution to his fellow heartburn sufferers everywhere.

  After years of planning and research, these two are now ready to present a formula that works quicker and lasts 4 times longer than any other antacid. And what's more, it does all this while promoting overall digestive health.
